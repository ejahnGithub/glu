# Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or any other similar characteristic.

- Please avoid using overtly sexual aliases or nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.
- Be kind and courteous. There’s no need to be mean or rude.
- Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries trade-offs and costs. There is seldom a single right answer.
- Keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
- We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean, or harass anyone. That is not welcome behavior. We interpret “harassment” as including the definition in the Citizen Code of Conduct; if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included, please read their definition. In particular, we don’t tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
- Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact a maintainer immediately. Whether you’re a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we’ve got your back.
- Spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by opening an issue or contacting a maintainer.

For more details, see the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/), which this project follows in spirit.
